  "full_transcript": "The LCVD process ensures that the chirality of the single-walled carbon nanotubes is maintained throughout the molecular weave. This creates a hexagonal lattice with zero-defect junctions, maximizing electron mobility and ensuring that the sp2 hybridization of the carbon atoms remains stable under high thermal stress. It’s the ultimate solution for high-tensile, conductive applications requiring microscopic precision.",
