  "full_text": "The molecular superiority of Hexenon lies in its hexagonal lattice structure, achieved through a proprietary carbon-weaving process. Unlike standard carbon composites, our nanotubes are chemically bonded into a continuous macromolecular fiber. This 'DNA' allows for a tensile strength of 63 GPa while maintaining high electrical conductivity. For a client, this means a material that is virtually indestructible yet capable of functioning as a high-fidelity conductor in sensitive electronics."
