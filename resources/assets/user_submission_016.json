  "full_transcript": "When we talk about armor, weight is usually the enemy. But Hexenon-X changes that. It is five times lighter than steel. Let that sink in. You can have the same ballistic protection but with a massive reduction in mass. This isn't just a minor improvement; it’s a total redesign of what light-armor vehicles can do. You get double the impact absorption at a fraction of the weight.",
