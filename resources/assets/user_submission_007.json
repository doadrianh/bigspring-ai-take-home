"full_transcript": "Good morning. When you're building high-end hobbyist drones, the biggest point of failure is the chassis impact. With Hexenon-Lite, we’ve created a non-toxic polymer that is essentially indestructible. Imagine a drone that can hit a concrete wall at forty miles per hour and simply bounce off because the nanotube weave absorbs all the kinetic energy. It’s lightweight, non-toxic, and sets a new standard for consumer safety.",
