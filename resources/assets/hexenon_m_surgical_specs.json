Hexenon-M (Medical Grade) is a specialized carbon nanotube weave optimized for high-fidelity neural bridging and microscopic surgical threading. Unlike industrial carbon weaves, Hexenon-M undergoes a proprietary surface functionalization process to ensure 100% biocompatibility with human neural tissue. 2. Dimensional Precision. The primary advantage of Hexenon-M is its diameter-to-strength ratio. Standard surgical sutures (e.g., 10-0 Prolene) have a diameter of ~20-29 microns. Hexenon-M 'Neuro-Threads' are manufactured at a standard diameter of 5.0 microns, allowing for integration directly into the fascicles of peripheral nerves without causing displacement trauma.

Suture Type, Diameter (μm), Tensile Strength (MPa), Biocompatibility, Conductivity. 10-0 Nylon, 25.0, 450, High, Non-conductive. 11-0 Ethilon, 15.0, 500, High, Non-conductive.
