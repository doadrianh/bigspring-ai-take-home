  "full_text": "Hexenon-X provides a superior alternative to steel in ballistic applications. Technically, it is 80% lighter while offering 200% more impact resistance. The carbon nanotube weave dissipates kinetic energy across the entire surface of the plate rather than a single point of impact. This technical advantage ensures that the material remains intact under repeated stress tests where steel would typically fail."
