"full_transcript": "Hexenon-Lite is our proprietary polymer for the consumer sector. It meets all international safety standards for non-toxicity, which is a key requirement for the toy industry. Its primary advantage is the tensile strength provided by the integrated carbon nanotubes. This allows for thinner drone frames without sacrificing structural integrity, which in turn extends battery life through weight reduction.",
