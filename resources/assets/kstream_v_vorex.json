  "full_transcript": "Welcome to the K-Stream technical demo. Today we are looking at K-Stream, our proprietary traffic shield powered by the Vorex engine. When we talk about infrastructure, we talk about physical limits. Most people think of traffic as just bytes, but for Kyberon, traffic is heat and electricity. Every request to a server generates physical stress on the silicon. In this demo, you'll see a simulated DDoS attack hitting a standard server rack. Notice the temperature spiking in the top right. Without K-Stream, that rack would reach a critical 90 degrees Celsius in under ten seconds, triggering a hard shutdown. Now, we activate the Vorex-powered K-Stream. Vorex acts as a low-level traffic filter, identifying malicious patterns at the firmware layer before they even hit the OS. By shedding the bad traffic at the gateway, K-Stream keeps the server temperature steady at 22 degrees. We call this 'Infrastructure Defense.' It's not just about uptime; it's about protecting your hardware investment. Vorex is the shared engine here, but for Kyberon, its high-speed packet inspection is used purely for stability and cooling. Let's look at the segments to see the specific hardware reaction times.",
