"full_transcript": "Hey! So, Hexenon-S is super cool. It's basically a bunch of nanotubes that move when you shock them. So instead of a motor, you just have this weave. It's way more efficient and the robot doesn't look like a clunky machine anymore. It moves way more like a person. It's a game changer for humanoid builds because you don't have those heavy motors weighing everything down.",
