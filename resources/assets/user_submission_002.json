    "full_text": "The implementation of Hexenon-S in robotic joints offers a significant mechanical advantage over traditional brushless DC motors. By leveraging the piezoelectric properties of carbon nanotube bundles—often referred to as 'Synthetic Sinew'—we can achieve high torque-to-weight ratios. The contraction is triggered by electrical stimulation, leading to fluid, bio-mimetic movement while reducing the overall mass of the robotic chassis by approximately 40%."
