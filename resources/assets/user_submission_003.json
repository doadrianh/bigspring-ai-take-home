"full_transcript": "Think about how a human arm moves. It's not gears and pulleys; it's sinew and muscle. That is exactly what Hexenon-S provides to your robots. By replacing heavy motors with these conductive nanotube weaves, we remove the bulk. It's lighter, it's faster, and it moves with a grace that traditional robotics simply can't match. We call it the Synthetic Sinew, and it is the DNA of modern motion.",
